# Vine-Game
It is in poor condition, and is quite dated (2009 student project). The idea is to draw lines to bounce up the falling objects. I think the particle effects aren't working. No reason to revisit this code, as next time I'll just rebuild from the ground up. Will revisit this project.
Had to update some things to make it XNA 4.0 compatible to see if it would even run. It is a shell of an idea, which I can't see anyone seeing what I was trying to do from just this. Might be down the line, but I will return to this project eventually and rebuild it with another system down the road.
